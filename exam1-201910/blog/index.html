                Some people give me a hard time about how long my blog posts are (you know who you are). They tell me I should break my posts
                into smaller posts, or suggest I consider a 500-word post for a change. I deserve the razzing, particularly
                when I publish a couple of 3,000-word posts back-to-back.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the absence of column inch or word limit restrictions, I‚Äôll use as many words as I need to get my point across. It‚Äôs not
                that I don‚Äôt know how to write short posts, it‚Äôs just not my preferred style. If I‚Äôm limited to 140 characters
                (for now at least), I‚Äôll use 140 characters. If I decide to write a 500-word post about how to write shorter
                blog posts, I can do it.
            </p>

            <p>
                To prove my point, you‚Äôre actually reading that 500-word post I mentioned. Here are six of the most-helpful tips I‚Äôve come
                across for writing shorter blog posts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Bite-Sized Content</h4> ‚Äì when planning posts, pick topics that can be addressed in 500 words or
                    less.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Get to the Point</h4> ‚Äì focus on one point for your topic. If you have more than one point to cover,
                    consider writing a separate post.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Blueprints Before Building</h4> ‚Äì before you start writing, create a quick outline for your post.
                    Focus on your opening, your main point, and your conclusion as the key ingredients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Omit Words</h4> ‚Äì review your post at least once and cut half your copy. Follow the ‚Äúomit needless
                    words‚Äù rule from ‚ÄúThe Elements of Style.‚Äú
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Worth 1,000 Words</h4> ‚Äì What image or graphic can literally take the place of 1,000 words in your
                    post? Or provide your readers with 700 ideas for headlines without writing a single one?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Supporting Info</h4> ‚Äì don‚Äôt repeat or rewrite things that exist elsewhere ‚Äì instead of saying it,
                    link to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Revise and Tighten</h4> ‚Äì if you‚Äôre not on deadline, keep revising until you copy is tight and you‚Äôre
                    completely satisfied.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As a bonus tip, I suggest you find a blogger who has mastered the art and science of writing short posts. For me, I enjoy
                reading and learning about startups from ‚ÄúDavid Cummings on Startups.‚Äù Cummings uses a consistent formula
                for his posts, which is part of the reason he‚Äôs been able to publish a new blog post EVERY DAY without fail
                for several years now. His posts typically flow like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A short, descriptive headline ‚Äì
                    <em> what topic today‚Äôs post is about</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    An introductory paragraph ‚Äì
                    <em>introduces main point around topic</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A bullet list of supporting points ‚Äì <em>backup for the main point ‚Äì often linked to helpful resources</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A summary paragraph ‚Äì <em>to reinforce the main topic</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A consistent request for feedback ‚Äì <em>always end with the CTA (call-to-action)</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm often surprised how much I learn from two paragraphs and a couple of bullets. I think his blog is a great example of
                how yo can deliver both quantity and quality from your blog.
