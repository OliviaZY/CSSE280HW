        The foods you choose to eat can have a direct impact on your ability to enjoy life to its fullest. Perhaps the most obvious
        positive effect of food is the pleasurable feeling you get from eating a good-tasting meal. It might be a plate of
        grilled chicken, corn-on-the-cob, fresh vine-ripened tomatoes, and a baked potato, or a steaming dish of spaghetti
        topped with a zesty tomato sauce.

        Your diet can have long-term effects on your health as well. Diet plays a major role in promoting and maintaining good health,
        preventing some chronic diseases and treating others, and speeding recovery from injuries. In earlier times, diseases
        such as goiter and pellagra were relatively commonâ€”both are caused by nutritional deficiencies and cured by diets
        containing sufficient amounts of a particular nutrient. In the case of goiter, iodine is the missing nutrient; with
        pellagra it is mainly niacin, a B vitamin. These diseases are rare today in the United States because most Americans
        get enough of t hese essential nutrients in their diets.
